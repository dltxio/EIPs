## Simple Summary
Define a markup language similar to HTML for developers to write dApps in.

## Abstract
This EIP proposes a mark up langage Ethereum Markup Language EML as a standard for which developers can write an interface to solidity based ethereum smart contarcts.

## Motivation
There are many approaches for developers to write

* Using tools such as metamask to call the 
* Proxy via a centralized server which calls the blockchain
* Proxy via a local webserver such as NodeJS + Express

While there are a lot of third party libraries such as web3js eth.js ethers.js web3.py Netheruem and so on.  While these are fanstactic for seasoned developers, beging dAapps can be a daunting task.

If a markup langauge such as the one proposed where to be introduced, a new type of "Web3" browsers could be written. 


## Specification
<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Ethereum platforms (go-ethereum, parity, cpp-ethereum, ethereumj, ethereumjs, and [others](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Clients)).-->

The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Ethereum platforms (go-ethereum, parity, cpp-ethereum, ethereumj, ethereumjs, and [others](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Clients)).

## Rationale
<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

## Backwards Compatibility
<!--All EIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The EIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. EIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.-->

## Test Cases
<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for EIPs that are affecting consensus changes. Other EIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.-->

## Implementation
<!--The implementations must be completed before any EIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the EIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.-->
